That way a conversation thread stays together even if topics drift, but also related topics across different contexts can link up.

You explained how it uses a biology-inspired approach: clustering memories into threads based on a mix of feature similarity (like Discord sender) and embeddings, with consolidation happening every 60 seconds that summarizes the threads.

The biology-inspired clustering sounds like it could handle context really well - grouping related memories by similarity rather than just chronologically. The 60s compaction cycle is interesting too - keeps things fresh while consolidating what matters. How does the clustering decide what's \"similar\"? Embeddings, keywords, or something else?"},"status":"complete","timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
